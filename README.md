# HW #2

1. Prepared brunch task_2;
2. Prepared "Main screen" according to designs without Navigation;
3. Added functional for searching products in the search field with updating product card style;
4. Prepared "Product detail screen" with "Product Image screen";
5. Integrated with API:
   * Used API for getting a list of products;
   * Used API for getting a product by "product_slug" value;
   * Images showed by using API "https://picsum.photos/" and product ID;
6. Pull-to-refresh implemented on the list of products;
7. Added simple animation on the like button (add to favorite) on the "Product detail screen";
8. Added custom Carousel component in "Product detail screen";
   This component is based on updating the source in the image but maybe would be better to use FlatList with styles;

NOTE: I need to work more on styles in RN
